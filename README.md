This repository will be used to store assignment files for this class (CTI-110).

# About Me
## Hobbies
* I love being outside! Right now I am really into gardening and have been doing a lot of landscaping/planting at my house. I also love hiking, camping, going to the pool and the lake.  
	* Last weekend, my boyfriend and I camped at Shenandoah. We want to go to the Great Smoky Mountains and Acadia soon!  
	* Last summer I went on a 6 week trip to the southwest. We visited 10 national parks.
* I have a bachelors degree in geology and currently work in the environmental field. I eventually want to get my masters in water resources engineering.
* I love to read
* I am a big coffee drinker and my espresso machine is probably my favorite thing that I own
* I like to cook and have been trying to get better at it.

## Websites I recommend
* [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) – I love Goodreads to share/keep track of the books I read and also to get recommendations and see what my friends are reading.
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) – I honestly use Reddit for everything, it’s so helpful when I have a question about, really anything.
